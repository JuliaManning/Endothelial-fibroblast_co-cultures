# Endothelial-fibroblast_co-cultures
Scripts for analysis of endothelial cell: firboblast co-cultures

HUVECs were cultured with firboblasts from patients with resolving arthritis (Res), very early arthritis (VeRA) and joint replacement (JRep) 

RNA isolated from the HUVECs and firboblasts, in particular to see if fibrboblats 

But large difference between HUVEC donors (which were also used in seperate batches) observed and sepertaion according to sex

Therefore sex genes were removed and batch corrections applied 

Data from this is in Julia Manning thesis - submitted to the University of Birmingham
